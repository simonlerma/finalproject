## THREE POSSIBLE ENDINGS

### HEAVEN ENDING 🕊️
Light fills the car on drive home. A life lived with kindness, integrity, and selflessness leads to eternal peace. Gates of Heaven open. Choices put others first, showed compassion, lived with honor.

### HELL ENDING 🔥
Road grows dark on drive home. Selfish choices, lies, and cruelty seal the fate. Ground opens beneath. Chose self over others, avoided responsibility, showed no compassion. Eternal regret awaits.

### PURGATORY ENDING ☁️
An unremarkable day ends. Neither particularly good nor evil. A lukewarm existence—did the bare minimum, missed chances for true goodness, but wasn't cruel. Forgotten in the middle.
